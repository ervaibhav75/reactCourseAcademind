    //here a story to understand whats agoing on here
    /*
    Imagine you have two friends, Tim and Mike. Tim is an expert in setting up challenges, and Mike is a master in presenting results. They want to collaborate on a project where Tim creates a time challenge, and Mike displays the result modal.

    Now, Tim (representing the TimerChallenge component) has a stopwatch. When the time is up, he wants to call Mike (representing the ResultModal component) to display the result. However, Tim doesn't know exactly how Mike will choose to present the result â€“ Mike might use a poster, a screen, or some other method.

    Here's how they collaborate:

    Tim (TimerChallenge) and His Stopwatch:

    Tim has a stopwatch (represented by timer.current).
    He knows that when the time is up, he wants to notify Mike to display the result.
    Mike (ResultModal) and His Presentation:

    Mike knows how to present the result using a dialog (represented by dialog.current).
    He also exposes an open method so that anyone, including Tim, can ask him to show the result.
    Connecting Tim and Mike with Refs:

    Tim wants to call Mike when the time is up, but he doesn't know how Mike will present the result.
    Tim creates a communication channel by giving Mike a phone (represented by dialog ref) and says, 
    "Mike, whenever I call you, use this phone to show the result."
    Two Phones, One Conversation:

    Tim and Mike each have a phone (a dialog ref). Tim has one, and Mike has one.
    When the time is up, Tim calls Mike using his phone (dialog.current.open()), and Mike answers on his 
    phone.
    Mike's phone (dialog.current) is connected to his presentation method (the actual dialog element).
    Tim doesn't need to know the details of how Mike's phone works; he just knows that calling it (dialog.
        current.open()) will make Mike present the result.
    In the code, ResultModal creates its own phone (dialog ref) and exposes an open method. 
    TimerChallenge has its own phone (dialog ref) that it passes to ResultModal when 
    they collaborate (<ResultModal ref={dialog} ... />).

    The two refs act as phones that enable communication between TimerChallenge and ResultModal, 
    allowing Tim and Mike to collaborate without knowing the internal details of 
    each other's implementations.
